          I had the pleasure of working with Rajesh Janyani and can confidently say they are an exceptional 
          Next.js developer. With a deep technical understanding, Rajesh Janyani consistently delivered 
          innovative solutions and played a key role in leading sprints and retrospectives. 
          They are also a fantastic mentor, always willing to help the team and guide junior developers. 
          Their leadership, product insight, and ability to collaborate effectively make them a valuable asset. 
          A true go-to person for both technical challenges and team support. 
          I highly recommend Rajesh Janyani for any team looking for a skilled and reliable developer.
